# GHOST: AI Behavioral Trading Coach

GHOST is a high-fidelity trading terminal designed to solve the #1 cause of trader failure: **Psychological Bias**. Using Gemini 3 Pro and Neon for persistent pattern memory, Ghost acts as a "Behavioral Firewall" that intercepts impulsive trades before they hit the exchange.

## 🚀 Features

- **Behavioral Firewall**: Real-time trade intent analysis that triggers a 10-second intervention if FOMO or Revenge trading patterns are detected.
- **Neural Persistence**: Every trade reasoning and outcome is synced to a persistent archive, building a unique "Psychological DNA" profile.
- **Post-Trade Mirror**: An AI-generated feedback loop that reconciles your trade reasoning with actual market outcomes.
- **Brain Archive**: A personalized trading course synthesized from your own historical data and mistakes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Intelligence**: Google Gemini API (2.5 & 3 series)
